# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
* Comparing successful and failed campaings

# Excel-Challenge


## Overview of Project:
* In this project we explored some of the features and functions that Excel has in order to make data easier to read and navigate.
* We learned how to analyze and clean up data so that we are able to work with data and find the results and answers we were hoping to get. 
* We were introduced on how and when to properly use functions such as: Iferror , countifs , and else if
* Learned how to create and build pivot tables and charts from data provided.


## Analysis and Challenges: 
* When performing the analysis for this project I mainly followed the steps from the module.
* When it came to anazlyzing the actual data it was pretty straight forward if you followed directions in the module.
* Once we cleaned the data up it was very easy to play with the data and see how different countries matched up versus each other.
* The biggest take away from the data is that the failed kickstarters failed because their initial goal was too high.


## Results: 
* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
** Majority of successful plays are launched in the summer. Canceled plays don't seem to have any correlation with successful or failed.
* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
** That the highest success rate is less than $5,000. And if the goal was between $5,000 and $25,000 there was about a %50 chance it would fail or succeed.
* What are some limitations of this dataset?
** Could be unfair markets or bad location, for instance some plays could be kickstarting in big cities or in places where plays are popular or a big event where as in other instnaces they are in smaller cities or places that do not support it the same. There are all kinds of outside limitations you would have to account for.
* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
** You could create a table or chart for a different category such as movies or television. You could also look at another country. You could compare different countries against each other. The possibilites are endless.
